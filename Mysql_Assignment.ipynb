        "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
        "Ans :\n",
        "Database : A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and querying of information.\n",
        "         It serves as a central repository for storing and managing data used by applications, systems, and users.\n",
        "There are 2 types of database systems :\n",
        "1. SQL : It stands for Structured Query Language. In SQL databases data are stored in the form of tables with predefined schema.\n",
        "          and data in those table is structured way means for all records, schema will be the same. These tables have fixed columns and column size\n",
        "          SQL databases typically provide ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and transactional reliability\n",
        "          Example : MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL\n",
        "\n",
        "2. NoSQL :It stands for Not only Structured Query Language. These type of database systems are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or rapidly changing data\n",
        "          In this, data is stored in the form of collection. Data is in the key value pair ( json or dictionary  format)\n",
        "          Data is unstructured. NoSQL Databases handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads\n",
