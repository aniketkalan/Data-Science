        "Ans :  In Python, multiprocessing is a module that allows the execution of multiple processes concurrently.\n",
        "      Each process has its own memory space, allowing for true parallel execution on systems with multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "Some key points highlighting the usefulness of multiprocessing in Python:\n",
        "1. Multiprocessing enables the execution of multiple processes simultaneously, taking advantage of the available CPU cores\n",
        "2. By utilizing multiple processes, multiprocessing can significantly enhance the performance of CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "3. Multiprocessing helps improve the responsiveness of applications by offloading computationally intensive tasks to separate processes\n",
        "4.  Each process in multiprocessing has its own memory space, ensuring isolation between processes. If one process encounters an error or crashes, it does not affect other processes.\n",
