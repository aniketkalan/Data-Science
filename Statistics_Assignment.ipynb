        "Mean: Calculating the average age of all participants.\n",

        "Example: A pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug to treat a specific medical condition. They conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving a sample of 500 patients. Inferential statistics can be applied to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the drug for the broader population of patients with the same condition. Some inferential statistics used in this context might include:\n",

        "Understanding the level of measurement is essential when analyzing data because it dictates the types of statistical analyses and operations that are valid and meaningful. Using inappropriate analyses or treating data at a higher level than it actually is can lead to incorrect conclusions and misleading interpretations. Here's an example to illustrate the importance of understanding the level of measurement:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine a study that aims to analyze the effects of different teaching methods on students' performance in a mathematics test. The study collects data on two variables: \"Teaching Method\" and \"Test Score.\" \"Teaching Method\" is a nominal variable with two categories: \"Traditional\" and \"Interactive.\" \"Test Score\" is an ordinal variable that indicates the level of performance as \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High.\"\n",

        "\n",
        "**Issue:** Treating \"Test Score\" as numerical and calculating the mean implies that the intervals between \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High\" scores are uniform and quantifiable. However, in reality, the ordinal nature of the data doesn't allow for such meaningful calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Correct Approach:** Recognizing that \"Test Score\" is ordinal, the researcher should use appropriate non-parametric tests, such as the Mann-Whitney U test, to compare the distribution of scores between the two teaching methods. These tests focus on the order of the data rather than assuming equal intervals.\n",

        "Use: The median is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean and is particularly useful when dealing with skewed or non-normally distributed data.\n",

        "Use: Standard deviation is widely used as a measure of variability. A larger standard deviation indicates greater dispersion, while a smaller standard deviation suggests that values are closer to the mean.\n",
